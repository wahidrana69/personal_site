        <h3>Game Devolopment</h3>
        <h4 class="name">May 2020- November 2021</h4>
        <p>I learn game development as a hobby. From a very little age, I was very interested in games. I used the Unity game engine for learning the development process. I learned environment designing, character movement, character design, modeling, and some necessary coding to make a game.</p>

        <h3>Web Designing</h3>
        <h4 class="name">january 2019 - March 2020</h4>
        <p>there is a saying "You can achieve anything if you put your mind to it."  I was also interested in web development. for that particular reason, I decided to learn web desing ing to know web development more deeply. That's why I learned web design on my own. learning web design on my own is not an exception. The resources I need are readily available online and in the market. So I started my learning. it is up to you to apply your knowledge and improve your skills further through constant practice and application. So I spend a lot of time and effort to make myself a good web designer.</p>
